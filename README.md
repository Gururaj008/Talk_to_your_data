# SmartText Insight

About the project:

SmartText Insight is an AI-driven application that simplifies document interaction and question-answering processes. Users can effortlessly upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files and receive contextually relevant responses to their inquiries. The application employs advanced natural language processing techniques and document embeddings to enhance user understanding of textual content. The technology behind SmartText Insight includes the integration of Google DeepMind's "Gemini-Pro" model, GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings for document embeddings, and FAISS vector store for efficient indexing. With a straightforward and user-friendly interface, SmartText Insight streamlines document exploration and facilitates intelligent interactions with textual data.
